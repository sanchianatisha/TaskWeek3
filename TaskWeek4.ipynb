        "At the same time, floating point performance of CPUs rarely exceeds 1 TFLOPs. For instance, Amazon's Graviton 3  reaches 2 TFLOPs peak performance for 16-bit precision operations, a number similar to the GPU performance of Apple's M1 processor.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many reasons why GPUs are much faster than CPUs in terms of FLOPs.\n",
        "First, power consumption tends to grow *quadratically* with clock frequency.\n",

        "There are also significant differences between AlexNet and LeNet.\n",
        "First, AlexNet is much deeper than the comparatively small LeNet-5.\n",
        "AlexNet consists of eight layers: five convolutional layers,\n",
        "two fully connected hidden layers, and one fully connected output layer.\n",
        "Second, AlexNet used the ReLU instead of the sigmoid\n",
        "as its activation function. Let's delve into the details below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "In AlexNet's first layer, the convolution window shape is $11\\times11$.\n",
        "Since the images in ImageNet are eight times taller and wider\n",
        "than the MNIST images,\n",
        "objects in ImageNet data tend to occupy more pixels with more visual detail.\n",
        "Consequently, a larger convolution window is needed to capture the object.\n",
        "The convolution window shape in the second layer\n",
        "is reduced to $5\\times5$, followed by $3\\times3$.\n",
        "In addition, after the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers,\n",
        "the network adds max-pooling layers\n",
        "with a window shape of $3\\times3$ and a stride of 2.\n",
        "Moreover, AlexNet has ten times more convolution channels than LeNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the final convolutional layer, there are two huge fully connected layers\n",
        "with 4096 outputs.\n",
        "These layers require nearly 1GB model parameters.\n",
        "Because of the limited memory in early GPUs,\n",
        "the original AlexNet used a dual data stream design,\n",
        "so that each of their two GPUs could be responsible\n",
        "for storing and computing only its half of the model.\n",
        "Fortunately, GPU memory is comparatively abundant now,\n",
        "so we rarely need to break up models across GPUs these days\n",
        "(our version of the AlexNet model deviates\n",
        "from the original paper in this aspect).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Activation Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, AlexNet changed the sigmoid activation function to a simpler ReLU activation function. On the one hand, the computation of the ReLU activation function is simpler. For example, it does not have the exponentiation operation found in the sigmoid activation function.\n",
        " On the other hand, the ReLU activation function makes model training easier when using different parameter initialization methods. This is because, when the output of the sigmoid activation function is very close to 0 or 1, the gradient of these regions is almost 0, so that backpropagation cannot continue to update some of the model parameters. By contrast, the gradient of the ReLU activation function in the positive interval is always 1 (:numref:`subsec_activation-functions`). Therefore, if the model parameters are not properly initialized, the sigmoid function may obtain a gradient of almost 0 in the positive interval, meaning that the model cannot be effectively trained.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Capacity Control and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "AlexNet controls the model complexity of the fully connected layer\n",
        "by dropout (:numref:`sec_dropout`),\n",
        "while LeNet only uses weight decay.\n",
        "To augment the data even further, the training loop of AlexNet\n",
        "added a great deal of image augmentation,\n",
        "such as flipping, clipping, and color changes.\n",
        "This makes the model more robust and the larger sample size effectively reduces overfitting.\n",
        "See :citet:`Buslaev.Iglovikov.Khvedchenya.ea.2020` for an in-depth review of such preprocessing steps.\n"

        "\n",
        "AlexNet's structure bears a striking resemblance to LeNet, with a number of critical improvements, both for accuracy (dropout) and for ease of training (ReLU). What is equally striking is the amount of progress that has been made in terms of deep learning tooling. What was several months of work in 2012 can now be accomplished in a dozen lines of code using any modern framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reviewing the architecture, we see that AlexNet has an Achilles heel when it comes to efficiency: the last two hidden layers require matrices of size $6400 \\times 4096$ and $4096 \\times 4096$, respectively. This corresponds to 164 MB of memory and 81 MFLOPs of computation, both of which are a nontrivial outlay, especially on smaller devices, such as mobile phones. This is one of the reasons why AlexNet has been surpassed by much more effective architectures that we will cover in the following sections. Nonetheless, it is a key step from shallow to deep networks that are used nowadays. Note that even though the number of parameters exceeds by far the amount of training data in our experiments (the last two layers have more than 40 million parameters, trained on a datasets of 60 thousand images), there is hardly any overfitting: training and validation loss are virtually identical throughout training. This is due to the improved regularization, such as dropout, inherent in modern deep network designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although it seems that there are only a few more lines in AlexNet's implementation than in LeNet's, it took the academic community many years to embrace this conceptual change and take advantage of its excellent experimental results. This was also due to the lack of efficient computational tools. At the time neither DistBelief :cite:`Dean.Corrado.Monga.ea.2012` nor Caffe :cite:`Jia.Shelhamer.Donahue.ea.2014` existed, and Theano :cite:`Bergstra.Breuleux.Bastien.ea.2010` still lacked many distinguishing features. It was the availability of TensorFlow :cite:`Abadi.Barham.Chen.ea.2016` that dramatically changed the situation.\n",

        "1. You are a chip designer and need to trade off computation and memory bandwidth. For example, a faster chip requires more power and possibly a larger chip area. More memory bandwidth requires more pins and control logic, thus also more area. How do you optimize?\n",
        "1. Why do engineers no longer report performance benchmarks on AlexNet?\n",
        "1. Try increasing the number of epochs when training AlexNet. Compared with LeNet, how do the results differ? Why?\n",
        "1. AlexNet may be too complex for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, in particular due to the low resolution of the initial images.\n",
        "    1. Try simplifying the model to make the training faster, while ensuring that the accuracy does not drop significantly.\n",
        "    1. Design a better model that works directly on $28 \\times 28$ images.\n",
        "1. Modify the batch size, and observe the changes in throughput (images/s), accuracy, and GPU memory.\n",
        "1. Apply dropout and ReLU to LeNet-5. Does it improve? Can you improve things further by preprocessing to take advantage of the invariances inherent in the images?\n",
        "1. Can you make AlexNet overfit? Which feature do you need to remove or change to break training?\n"

        "Memory characteristics, including read and write bandwidth, latency, and size, have a significant impact on computation in both training and inference of neural networks. These factors can influence the overall performance, efficiency, and speed of the computation. Here's how these memory aspects affect computation and any potential differences between training and inference:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Read and Write Bandwidth**:\n",
        "- **Effect**: High read and write bandwidth enables faster data movement between memory and processing units. It allows for efficient data retrieval and storage during computations.\n",
        "- **Impact**: Faster data access improves the throughput of computations, reducing the time spent waiting for data to arrive. It can lead to faster training and inference times.\n",
        "- **Training vs. Inference**: Both training and inference benefit from high bandwidth, as data movement is a common bottleneck in both phases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Latency**:\n",
        "- **Effect**: Latency is the time taken to access data from memory. Lower latency results in quicker data access and faster computations.\n",
        "- **Impact**: Low-latency memory access reduces the time spent waiting for data to be available for computations, leading to improved processing speed.\n",
        "- **Training vs. Inference**: Latency affects both training and inference. In training, frequent weight updates and gradient computations require low-latency access to data. In inference, quick responses are crucial for real-time applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Memory Size**:\n",
        "- **Effect**: Memory size determines how much data can be stored. Larger memory allows for more data to be cached, reducing the need for frequent data movement.\n",
        "- **Impact**: Sufficient memory size enables efficient caching of data and reduces the need for frequent memory access. It can lead to better performance by avoiding memory bottlenecks.\n",
        "- **Training vs. Inference**: Both training and inference benefit from having enough memory to hold intermediate results and data. In training, large memory can accommodate gradients, activations, and model parameters. In inference, it allows for storing intermediate results during feedforward passes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Training and Inference Differences**:\n",
        "- In training, memory bandwidth is often crucial due to the frequent updates of weights and gradients during backpropagation. Batch processing amplifies memory bandwidth requirements.\n",
        "- In inference, low latency and high memory bandwidth are important for real-time applications, but the focus might shift slightly towards optimizing for latency and response time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Memory Hierarchy**:\n",
        "- Modern architectures often have different memory levels with varying characteristics (e.g., cache, GPU memory, main memory). Optimizing data placement and movement across these levels is crucial for performance.\n",
        "- Memory hierarchy can impact both training and inference by affecting how efficiently data is accessed and utilized.\n",

        "Yes, it is possible to intentionally make AlexNet overfit by manipulating certain features of the training process. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to perform exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. To make AlexNet overfit, you can modify or manipulate the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Limited Training Data**:\n",
        "   Reduce the size of the training dataset significantly. With a small training dataset, the model can easily memorize the data, leading to overfitting. For example, if you have 10 classes, consider training with just a handful of images for each class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Complex Model**:\n",
        "   Increase the model's capacity by adding more layers, units, or filters. This can lead to the model having more parameters than necessary to fit the small training data, resulting in overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reduce Regularization**:\n",
        "   Decrease or entirely remove regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and data augmentation. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding noise or constraints to the training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Lower Learning Rate**:\n",
        "   Use a very small learning rate during training. A small learning rate can cause the model to update its weights very slowly, leading to overfitting as the model doesn't generalize well.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Fewer Epochs**:\n",
        "   Train the model for a limited number of epochs. Overfitting can occur when the model hasn't had sufficient time to learn meaningful patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Noise-Free Labels**:\n",
        "   Provide perfectly clean and noise-free labels in the training dataset. In real-world scenarios, there are often label errors or ambiguity, which can actually help prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Lack of Augmentation**:\n",
        "   Avoid data augmentation techniques like random rotations, flips, and cropping. Data augmentation introduces variability and helps the model generalize better.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Use Complex Optimizers**:\n",
        "   Opt for complex optimizers like Adam with default settings, which can lead to quicker convergence on the training data but might also cause overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining these changes, you can create a scenario in which AlexNet overfits the training data. Keep in mind that this exercise is done for demonstration purposes and to understand the behavior of models under different conditions. In practice, overfitting is undesirable, and the goal is to achieve a model that generalizes well to unseen data. Regularization techniques, appropriate dataset splitting, and hyperparameter tuning are used to avoid overfitting and build models with strong generalization performance."

        "\n",
        "One might argue that VGG is the first truly modern convolutional neural network. While AlexNet introduced many of the components of what make deep learning effective at scale, it is VGG that arguably introduced key properties such as blocks of multiple convolutions and a preference for deep and narrow networks. It is also the first network that is actually an entire family of similarly parametrized models, giving the practitioner ample trade-off between complexity and speed. This is also the place where modern deep learning frameworks shine. It is no longer necessary to generate XML configuration files to specify a network but rather, to assemble said networks through simple Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "More recently ParNet :cite:`Goyal.Bochkovskiy.Deng.ea.2021` demonstrated that it is possible to achieve competitive performance using a much more shallow architecture through a large number of parallel computations. This is an exciting development and there is hope that it will influence architecture designs in the future. For the remainder of the chapter, though, we will follow the path of scientific progress over the past decade.\n",

        "    1. Compare the number of floating point operations used in the convolutional layers and in the fully connected layers.\n",
        "    1. How could you reduce the computational cost created by the fully connected layers?\n",
        "1. When displaying the dimensions associated with the various layers of the network, we only see the information associated with eight blocks (plus some auxiliary transforms), even though the network has 11 layers. Where did the remaining three layers go?\n",
        "1. Use Table 1 in the VGG paper :cite:`Simonyan.Zisserman.2014` to construct other common models, such as VGG-16 or VGG-19.\n",
        "1. Upsampling the resolution in Fashion-MNIST eight-fold from $28 \\times 28$ to $224 \\times 224$ dimensions is very wasteful. Try modifying the network architecture and resolution conversion, e.g., to 56 or to 84 dimensions for its input instead. Can you do so without reducing the accuracy of the network? Consult the VGG paper :cite:`Simonyan.Zisserman.2014` for ideas on adding more nonlinearities prior to downsampling.\n"

        "Reducing the computational cost created by fully connected layers can help improve the efficiency of neural networks while maintaining or even enhancing their performance. Here are several strategies to achieve this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Global Average Pooling (GAP)**:\n",
        "   Instead of using fully connected layers at the end of the network, apply global average pooling. This operation computes the average of each feature map and produces a single value for each channel. GAP reduces the number of parameters and computations significantly while retaining important spatial information.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Replace with Convolutional Layers**:\n",
        "   Convert fully connected layers into convolutional layers with kernel size 1x1. This allows for weight sharing across spatial locations and reduces the number of parameters. Transition from fully connected layers to 1x1 convolutions can often be done without sacrificing performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Network Pruning**:\n",
        "   Apply network pruning techniques to identify and remove unnecessary connections, neurons, or filters in the fully connected layers. Pruning reduces the number of parameters and computations while maintaining accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Low-Rank Approximations**:\n",
        "   Approximate fully connected weight matrices with low-rank matrices using techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This reduces the number of parameters and speeds up computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Dimension Reduction Techniques**:\n",
        "   Apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the input dimensionality of fully connected layers. This can reduce the number of parameters and computations required.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**:\n",
        "   Replace fully connected layers with depthwise separable convolutions. These convolutions separate spatial and channel-wise filtering, reducing the number of parameters and computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Quantization**:\n",
        "   Quantize fully connected layers to lower precision (e.g., 8-bit) to reduce memory usage and computation. Techniques like quantization-aware training can help minimize the impact on accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Knowledge Distillation**:\n",
        "   Use knowledge distillation to train a smaller student network to mimic the behavior of a larger teacher network. This can help maintain performance while reducing the computational cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Model Compression**:\n",
        "   Apply model compression techniques like Huffman coding, weight sharing, or tensor factorization to reduce the size and computational complexity of fully connected layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Hybrid Architectures**:\n",
        "    Design hybrid architectures that combine convolutional and fully connected layers. Use fully connected layers only in specific parts of the network where they are essential.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "NiN has dramatically fewer parameters than AlexNet and VGG. This stems primarily from the fact that it needs no giant fully connected layers. Instead, it uses global average pooling to aggregate across all image locations after the last stage of the network body. This obviates the need for expensive (learned) reduction operations and replaces them by a simple average. What surprised researchers at the time was the fact that this averaging operation did not harm accuracy. Note that averaging across a low-resolution representation (with many channels) also adds to the amount of translation invariance that the network can handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing fewer convolutions with wide kernels and replacing them by $1 \\times 1$ convolutions aids the quest for fewer parameters further. It can cater for a significant amount of nonlinearity across channels within any given location. Both $1 \\times 1$ convolutions and global average pooling significantly influenced subsequent CNN designs.\n",

        "1. **Two $1\\times1$ Convolutional Layers per NiN Block**:\n",
        "   - When there are two $1\\times1$ convolutional layers per NiN block, it creates multiple pathways for feature transformation. Each $1\\times1$ convolution performs its own set of operations, allowing the network to capture complex relationships between features and enable better representation learning.\n",
        "   - Having two $1\\times1$ convolutions can increase the model's capacity and non-linearity, potentially leading to improved accuracy and more expressive features.\n",

        "   - Reducing the number of $1\\times1$ convolutions also decreases the number of parameters and computations, which can be beneficial for faster training and reduced memory usage.\n",

        "Reducing the 384×5×5 representation to a 10×5×5 representation in one step in Network in Network (NiN) architecture can lead to several potential problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Loss of Information**: Reducing the representation from 384 channels to only 10 channels in a single step can result in a significant loss of information. Each channel contains specific features and patterns learned by the network, and reducing them abruptly might lead to loss of discriminative power.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Underfitting**: The reduced 10-channel representation might not have enough capacity to capture the complexity of the original input. This can result in the model underfitting the data, leading to poor generalization and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Information Bottleneck**: Such a drastic reduction in the number of channels creates an information bottleneck, limiting the network's ability to transform the input effectively. It can hinder the network's learning capability and limit its expressive power.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Reduced Expressiveness**: Reducing the number of channels too quickly can limit the model's ability to learn high-level features and hierarchical representations of the input data. Deep networks often rely on progressively learning more abstract features.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Spatial Features**: A representation of 10×5×5 doesn't capture spatial features well. Important spatial patterns and relationships present in the original representation might be lost, making the network less capable of recognizing objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Loss of Discriminative Power**: With a smaller representation, the network might struggle to differentiate between different classes, leading to confusion and decreased accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "To mitigate these problems, it's common to use intermediate layers with smaller reductions in the number of channels, allowing the network to learn gradually more abstract and complex features. The NiN architecture typically uses multiple consecutive NiN blocks to avoid these issues by applying multiple nonlinear transformations with $1\\times1$ convolutions, gradually reducing the number of channels over several steps, and maintaining the network's ability to learn meaningful representations."

It was arguably also the first network that exhibited a clear distinction among the stem (data ingest), body (data processing), and head (prediction) in a CNN. This design pattern has persisted ever since in the design of deep networks: the *stem* is given by the first two or three convolutions that operate on the image. They extract low-level features from the underlying images. This is followed by a *body* of convolutional blocks. Finally, the *head* maps the features obtained so far to the required classification, segmentation, detection, or tracking problem at hand.\n",

        "Both GoogLeNet and AlexNet are deep neural network architectures, but they have significant differences in terms of computation requirements due to their architectural designs. The comparison of computation needs between GoogLeNet and AlexNet can have implications for the design of accelerator chips.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Computation Requirements**:\n",
        "   - **GoogLeNet**: GoogLeNet uses the inception module, which involves multiple parallel convolutional paths and pooling operations. This design introduces a higher level of parallelism, leading to reduced computation within each individual path. Additionally, the use of 1x1 convolutions helps reduce the number of parameters and computations.\n",
        "   - **AlexNet**: AlexNet has a simpler architecture compared to GoogLeNet. It primarily consists of convolutional and pooling layers, with fewer parallel paths. The overall computation tends to be higher due to the uniform filter sizes and deeper architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Memory Size and Bandwidth**:\n",
        "   - **GoogLeNet**: The parallel paths in the inception module allow for more efficient memory utilization since each path's intermediate results can be stored separately. This reduces the demand for a large global memory space and might allow for better memory bandwidth utilization.\n",
        "   - **AlexNet**: The uniform filter sizes and deeper architecture may require larger memory space to store intermediate results, leading to potentially higher memory bandwidth demands.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Cache Size**:\n",
        "   - **GoogLeNet**: The parallelism in GoogLeNet might benefit from a larger cache size, as different paths can make better use of cache space.\n",
        "   - **AlexNet**: The deeper architecture and potentially higher temporal locality due to the sequential nature of computation might benefit from a larger cache as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Amount of Computation**:\n",
        "   - **GoogLeNet**: Due to the efficient use of parallelism and dimensionality reduction, GoogLeNet generally requires less computation compared to its accuracy level.\n",
        "   - **AlexNet**: AlexNet requires more computation due to its uniform filter sizes and deeper architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Specialized Operations**:\n",
        "   - Both architectures might benefit from specialized operations provided by an accelerator chip. For instance, 1x1 convolutions and depth-wise separable convolutions, which are used in GoogLeNet, can be implemented as hardware-friendly operations in an accelerator chip to further improve efficiency.\n",
        "   \n",
        "In terms of designing an accelerator chip for these architectures:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory**: An accelerator chip for GoogLeNet might require memory structures that can handle the efficient storage and retrieval of intermediate results from parallel paths. For AlexNet, a larger memory capacity might be necessary to accommodate the deeper architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory Bandwidth**: The chip should ensure sufficient memory bandwidth to facilitate efficient data movement between different layers and paths, taking into consideration the architecture's specific memory access patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cache**: A larger cache size might be beneficial for both architectures to reduce memory access latency and improve temporal locality.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Specialized Operations**: The accelerator chip could include specialized hardware units for performing 1x1 convolutions and depth-wise separable convolutions, as these operations are common in modern architectures like GoogLeNet and contribute to performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Parallelism**: The chip could be designed to exploit parallelism efficiently, especially for architectures like GoogLeNet that utilize parallel paths extensively.\n",
        "\n",

Understanding the architectural characteristics of these models helps in designing hardware that maximizes efficiency and performance."

        "Intuitively, batch normalization is thought\n",
        "to make the optimization landscape smoother.\n",
        "However, we must be careful to distinguish between\n",
        "speculative intuitions and true explanations\n",
        "for the phenomena that we observe when training deep models.\n",
        "Recall that we do not even know why simpler\n",
        "deep neural networks (MLPs and conventional CNNs)\n",
        "generalize well in the first place.\n",
        "Even with dropout and weight decay,\n",
        "they remain so flexible that their ability to generalize to unseen data\n",
        "likely needs significantly more refined learning-theoretic generalization guarantees.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original paper proposing batch normalization :cite:`Ioffe.Szegedy.2015`, in addition to introducing a powerful and useful tool,\n",
        "offered an explanation for why it works:\n",
        "by reducing *internal covariate shift*.\n",
        "Presumably by *internal covariate shift* they\n",
        "meant something like the intuition expressed above---the\n",
        "notion that the distribution of variable values changes\n",
        "over the course of training.\n",
        "However, there were two problems with this explanation:\n",
        "i) This drift is very different from *covariate shift*,\n",
        "rendering the name a misnomer. If anything, it is closer to concept drift.\n",
        "ii) The explanation offers an under-specified intuition\n",
        "but leaves the question of *why precisely this technique works*\n",
        "an open question wanting for a rigorous explanation.\n",
        "Throughout this book, we aim to convey the intuitions that practitioners\n",
        "use to guide their development of deep neural networks.\n",
        "However, we believe that it is important\n",
        "to separate these guiding intuitions\n",
        "from established scientific fact.\n",
        "Eventually, when you master this material\n",

        "Batch normalization is a technique that helps stabilize and accelerate the training of deep neural networks. It normalizes the activations within a layer by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the mini-batch. The normalized activations are then scaled and shifted using learnable parameters: the scale (gamma) and shift (beta) parameters.\n",

        "Whether to apply batch normalization in every layer of a neural network is not a strict rule but a design choice that depends on the specific problem, architecture, and training dynamics. The decision can impact the model's convergence, performance, and training stability. Here are some considerations to help you decide:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages of Batch Normalization in Every Layer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Stabilized Training**: Applying batch normalization in every layer helps stabilize training by normalizing activations and reducing internal covariate shifts, which can lead to faster convergence and more stable gradient propagation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Regularization**: Batch normalization has an inherent regularization effect, which can help prevent overfitting. Applying it in every layer might provide consistent regularization throughout the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Deeper Architectures**: For very deep networks, applying batch normalization in every layer can help mitigate gradient vanishing/exploding problems, enabling the training of even deeper models.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Less Sensitive to Initialization**: Batch normalization can reduce the sensitivity to weight initialization, allowing you to use larger learning rates and more aggressive optimization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Considerations Against Batch Normalization in Every Layer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reduced Model Capacity**: Batch normalization can suppress the network's capacity to fit the training data. Applying it too frequently might lead to underfitting, especially in smaller models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Slower Training**: Adding batch normalization to every layer increases computational overhead, which might slow down training, especially on hardware with limited resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Loss of Expressiveness**: Excessive normalization can remove useful information from activations, potentially limiting the model's expressiveness. It can also hinder the model's ability to memorize certain patterns, which could be desirable in some scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Unstable for Very Small Batches**: Batch normalization relies on batch statistics, which can be unstable for very small batches. In such cases, using batch normalization in every layer might lead to poor performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Guidelines and Best Practices:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Experiment**: It's recommended to experiment with different configurations, including applying batch normalization selectively or in every layer. Test the impact on validation performance, convergence speed, and generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Network Depth**: Deeper networks tend to benefit more from batch normalization in every layer due to the vanishing gradient problem. For shallower networks, you might achieve good results with selective application.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Use Validation**: Monitor validation performance during training to detect potential overfitting caused by excessive batch normalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Small Datasets**: For small datasets, you might need to be more cautious with normalization. Experiment with validation performance to find the right balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Different Architectures**: Different architectures might respond differently to batch normalization. What works for one architecture might not work optimally for another.\n",

The choice depends on your specific use case, the architecture of your model, the dataset, and computational constraints."

        "Using a full-rank covariance estimate instead of the standard normalization transform (mean and variance) in batch normalization is an interesting idea, but it's not typically recommended for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Computational Complexity**: Computing the full-rank covariance matrix is more computationally expensive compared to calculating the mean and variance. The covariance matrix has quadratic complexity with respect to the input dimensions, while mean and variance calculations are linear. This added complexity can slow down training significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dimension Mismatch**: Batch normalization is applied independently to each channel (feature) in the input. When computing the covariance matrix, you would typically need to consider interactions between different channels, which could lead to a higher-dimensional covariance matrix. This might not work well for the normalization purposes of batch normalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Instability**: Computing the full-rank covariance matrix on small batch sizes or when the data has high dimensionality can lead to numerical instability and ill-conditioned covariance matrices. Regularization or other techniques might be needed to ensure numerical stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Overfitting**: Using a full-rank covariance matrix could introduce additional learnable parameters. This might lead to overfitting, especially if the network is not large enough or the dataset is not sufficiently diverse.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Loss of Orthogonality**: One of the benefits of batch normalization is that it maintains the orthogonality between the weight updates and the gradient updates during backpropagation. Introducing a full-rank covariance matrix might break this orthogonality, leading to slower convergence or training instability.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Normalization Properties**: Batch normalization is designed to normalize each channel's activations independently. A full-rank covariance estimate might introduce interdependencies between channels, which could disrupt the normalization properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Lack of Empirical Support**: The standard batch normalization approach using mean and variance has been empirically proven to work well across a wide range of network architectures and tasks. There's less evidence supporting the effectiveness of using a full-rank covariance estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while the idea of using a full-rank covariance matrix in batch normalization is intriguing, it's not commonly used due to the potential drawbacks in terms of computational complexity, instability, and the mismatch between batch normalization's design principles and the properties of a full-rank covariance matrix. The standard normalization transforms (mean and variance) have been well-tested and proven to be effective in stabilizing and accelerating the training of neural networks."

Sparsification refers to the process of converting certain weights or parameters in a model to zero, effectively creating a sparse representation. This process can have a regularizing effect on the model's learning process and can help prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how sparsification compression can act as a regularizer:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Reduced Model Complexity**: Sparsification reduces the number of active parameters in the model, leading to a simpler model representation. This can help prevent the model from capturing noise in the training data and focusing on the most relevant features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Prevention of Overfitting**: A sparse model is less likely to overfit the training data because it has fewer degrees of freedom. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and fits noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization to unseen data. Sparsification helps mitigate this by limiting the model's capacity to overfit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Improved Generalization**: Regularization techniques like sparsification often lead to improved generalization performance. By encouraging the model to focus on the most informative features, the model becomes more robust and performs better on new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Interpretability**: Sparse models are often more interpretable because they highlight the most influential features. This can provide insights into which features are driving the model's decisions, making it easier to understand and debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Efficiency**: Sparse models are computationally more efficient, as they involve fewer computations during inference. This efficiency can be beneficial for deploying models to resource-constrained environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that while sparsification compression can provide regularization benefits, the degree of regularization depends on the extent of sparsity and the sparsification method used. Various techniques, such as L1 regularization (lasso), dropout, or techniques specific to neural network pruning, can be used to induce sparsity and act as regularization in different contexts. However, the exact regularization effect might vary based on the specific problem, dataset, and architecture."

        "Yes, there are several other types of projections and transforms that can be used in various mathematical and computational contexts. These projections are often used to achieve specific properties, structures, or constraints on data or mathematical objects. Here are a few examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Convex Cone Projection**: Convex cones are sets of vectors that are closed under linear combinations with non-negative coefficients. Projecting onto a convex cone involves finding the point in the cone that is closest to a given vector. This kind of projection is often used in optimization problems where the solution must satisfy certain constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Symmetry Group-Specific Transforms**: In some applications, you might want to transform data or objects to respect specific symmetries. For example, in crystallography, Fourier transforms are used to reveal the symmetry of a crystal lattice. In image processing, you might use transforms that respect rotational or translational symmetries.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Orthogonal Projection**: Orthogonal projection involves finding the closest point in a subspace to a given vector. This type of projection is commonly used in linear algebra and optimization, where you might want to find the best approximation of a vector within a subspace.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Quantization**: Quantization is a projection-like operation used to map continuous values to a discrete set of values. It's often used in signal processing and data compression to reduce the number of possible values while minimizing information loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Manifold Embedding**: Manifold learning techniques aim to embed high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces while preserving certain properties or structures. Techniques like Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are examples of such manifold embedding methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Orthogonal Procrustes Problem**: In linear algebra, the Orthogonal Procrustes Problem involves finding an orthogonal transformation (rotation and reflection) that best aligns two sets of points. It's often used in computer graphics, shape analysis, and alignment tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are just a few examples of the many types of projections and transforms used in various fields. The choice of projection or transform depends on the problem at hand and the specific properties or constraints you want to achieve."

One way of accomplishing this is by letting additional layers to simply pass through the input to the output. Residual connections allow for this. As a consequence, this changes the inductive bias from simple functions being of the form $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ to simple functions looking like $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$.\n",

We can train an effective *deep* neural network by having residual blocks. Inputs can forward propagate faster through the residual connections across layers. As a consequence, we can thus train much deeper networks. For instance, the original ResNet paper :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016` allowed for up to 152 layers. Another benefit of residual networks is that it allows us to add layers, initialized as the identity function, *during* the training process. After all, the default behavior of a layer is to let the data pass through unchanged. This can accelerate the training of very large networks in some cases.\n",

        "ResNeXt is an example for how the design of convolutional neural networks has evolved over time: by being more frugal with computation and trading it off against the size of the activations (number of channels), it allows for faster and more accurate networks at lower cost. An alternative way of viewing grouped convolutions is to think of a block-diagonal matrix for the convolutional weights. Note that there are quite a few such \"tricks\" that lead to more efficient networks. For instance, ShiftNet :cite:`wu2018shift` mimicks the effects of a $3 \\times 3$ convolution, simply by adding shifted activations to the channels, offering increased function complexity, this time without any computational cost.\n",

The Inception block focuses on capturing features at different scales using parallel operations, while the residual block focuses on enabling the training of very deep networks by introducing skip connections that facilitate the learning of residual transformations. Both architectural components have been instrumental in advancing the capabilities of deep neural networks for various tasks."

        "Increasing the complexity of functions without bound, even when using nested function classes, can lead to several issues in machine learning and model training. There are fundamental challenges related to model capacity, overfitting, computational complexity, and generalization. Here's why it's not a practical approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Overfitting**: When you increase the complexity of a model without considering the data's true underlying patterns, the model can start fitting noise in the training data. This leads to overfitting, where the model performs very well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Computational Complexity**: Complex models with many parameters require more computational resources and time for training and inference. This can lead to practical challenges in terms of training time, memory usage, and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Diminishing Returns**: Increasing model complexity does not necessarily result in proportionate improvements in performance. There's a point where adding more complexity provides marginal or diminishing returns in terms of improved accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Generalization**: A model's primary goal is to generalize well to new, unseen data. If the model becomes too complex, it may become overly specialized to the training data and fail to generalize to new instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Regularization Challenges**: Without proper regularization techniques, increasing complexity can exacerbate overfitting. Regularization techniques help control model complexity and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Interpretability**: Highly complex models can become difficult to interpret, making it hard to understand their decision-making processes and diagnose issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Data Efficiency**: Simpler models are often more data-efficient. Extremely complex models might require vast amounts of training data to generalize well.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Bias-Variance Trade-off**: Increasing model complexity influences the balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting). Finding the right balance is crucial for good performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of unbounded complexity, it's more effective to choose model architectures that strike the right balance between capacity and generalization. Techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and ensemble methods can help improve model performance without unnecessarily increasing complexity. Ultimately, the goal is to build models that can capture the underlying patterns in the data while avoiding overfitting and computational inefficiencies."

        "In DenseNet architectures, transition layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of feature maps while also reducing the number of feature maps (channels) before passing them to the next dense block. The choice between average pooling and max-pooling in transition layers depends on the design goals and the desired properties of the network. In DenseNet, average pooling is often preferred over max-pooling for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Feature Retention**: Average pooling computes the average value of the elements in a pooling region. This retains more information about the features compared to max-pooling, which only selects the maximum value. In DenseNet, where information from all previous layers is concatenated together, average pooling helps in maintaining a more comprehensive representation of the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Smoothing Effect**: Average pooling has a smoothing effect on the output feature maps. This can help in reducing the risk of overfitting by preventing the network from becoming too sensitive to specific details in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stability**: Average pooling is less sensitive to outliers compared to max-pooling. This can make the network more robust to noise or variations in the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Translation Invariance**: Average pooling provides a certain degree of translation invariance by taking into account the overall distribution of values in the pooling region. This can be beneficial in scenarios where small translations of the input should not significantly affect the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Information Sharing**: Average pooling promotes information sharing among neighboring pixels or units. This can help in capturing global patterns and structures present in the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "While average pooling is preferred in transition layers, max-pooling can still have its own advantages in certain contexts. For example, in architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that prioritize capturing local features and enhancing feature maps, max-pooling can be effective. However, in DenseNet's context, where the emphasis is on maintaining rich information flow and reducing the risk of information loss, average pooling aligns better with the architecture's principles.\n",
        "\n",

        "The reason why DenseNet has smaller model parameters than ResNet is because DenseNet uses **dense connections** between layers, which means that each layer receives the feature maps of all preceding layers as input and passes its own feature maps to all subsequent layers. This way, the number of channels (filters) in each layer can be reduced, since the layer can reuse the features from previous layers. ResNet, on the other hand, uses **residual connections**, which means that each layer only receives the output of the previous layer and adds it to its own output. This requires more channels in each layer to learn new features, since the layer cannot access the features from earlier layers. According to the DenseNet paper¹, a 121-layer DenseNet has 7.98 million parameters, while a 152-layer ResNet has 60.19 million parameters. This is a significant difference in model size and complexity.\n",

        "Reducing memory consumption in a DenseNet architecture can be achieved through various strategies. One approach is to introduce sparsity into the model, which reduces the number of active connections and parameters. Here's how you might change the framework to achieve this:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Sparse Connectivity in Dense Blocks:**\n",
        "Instead of having fully connected dense blocks, you can introduce sparse connectivity patterns. This means that not every layer connects to every other layer in the dense block. You can achieve this by randomly selecting a subset of previous layers' feature maps to concatenate with the current layer. This reduces the number of connections and memory consumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Channel Pruning:**\n",
        "Apply channel pruning techniques to the dense blocks. You can identify less important channels and remove them from the concatenation operation. This effectively reduces the number of active channels and saves memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Regularization and Compression:**\n",
        "Introduce regularization techniques like L1 regularization during training to encourage certain weights to become exactly zero. Additionally, you can explore model compression methods like knowledge distillation or quantization to reduce the memory footprint of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Low-Rank Approximations:**\n",
        "Perform low-rank matrix factorization on the weight matrices in the dense blocks. This technique approximates the weight matrices with lower-dimensional factors, leading to reduced memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Dynamic Allocation:**\n",
        "Allocate memory dynamically during inference to only store the necessary feature maps. This technique avoids allocating memory for feature maps that are no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Sparsity-Inducing Activation Functions:**\n",
        "Use activation functions that naturally induce sparsity, such as the ReLU6 function, which caps activations at a maximum value and can lead to some neurons becoming inactive.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. Adaptive Dense Blocks:**\n",
        "Design adaptive dense blocks that dynamically adjust their connectivity patterns based on the data distribution. For example, you can use attention mechanisms to determine which previous feature maps to concatenate based on their importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing these changes would require modifications to the architecture, training procedure, and potentially custom layers or modifications to existing layers. It's important to note that these techniques might involve a trade-off between memory reduction and model performance. It's recommended to experiment and fine-tune these strategies on your specific problem domain to find the right balance."

        "\n",
        "The previous sections have taken us on a tour of modern network design for computer vision. Common to all the work we covered was that it greatly relied on the intuition of scientists. Many of the architectures are heavily informed by human creativity and to a much lesser extent by systematic exploration of the design space that deep networks offer. Nonetheless, this *network engineering* approach has been tremendously successful.\n",

        "Ever since AlexNet (:numref:`sec_alexnet`)\n",
        "beat conventional computer vision models on ImageNet,\n",
        "it has become popular to construct very deep networks\n",
        "by stacking blocks of convolutions, all designed according to the same pattern.\n",
        "In particular, $3 \\times 3$ convolutions were\n",
        "popularized by VGG networks (:numref:`sec_vgg`).\n",
        "NiN (:numref:`sec_nin`) showed that even $1 \\times 1$ convolutions could\n",
        "be beneficial by adding local nonlinearities.\n",
        "Moreover, NiN solved the problem of aggregating information at the head of a network\n",
        "by aggregating across all locations.\n",
        "GoogLeNet (:numref:`sec_googlenet`) added multiple branches of different convolution width,\n",
        "combining the advantages of VGG and NiN in its Inception block.\n",
        "ResNets (:numref:`sec_resnet`)\n",
        "changed the inductive bias towards the identity mapping (from $f(x) = 0$). This allowed for very deep networks. Almost a decade later, the ResNet design is still popular, a testament to its design. Lastly, ResNeXt (:numref:`subsec_resnext`) added grouped convolutions, offering a better trade-off between parameters and computation. A precursor to Transformers for vision, the Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENets) allow for efficient information transfer between locations\n",
        ":cite:`Hu.Shen.Sun.2018`. This was accomplished by computing a per-channel global attention function.\n",

        "Up to now we have omitted networks obtained via *neural architecture search* (NAS) :cite:`zoph2016neural,liu2018darts`. We chose to do so since their cost is usually enormous, relying on brute-force search, genetic algorithms, reinforcement learning, or some other form of hyperparameter optimization. Given a fixed search space,\n",
        "NAS uses a search strategy to automatically select\n",
        "an architecture based on the returned performance estimation.\n",

        "In the following we discuss an idea that is quite different to the quest for the *single best network*. It is computationally relatively inexpensive, it leads to scientific insights on the way, and it is quite effective in terms of the quality of outcomes. Let's review the strategy by :citet:`Radosavovic.Kosaraju.Girshick.ea.2020` to *design network design spaces*. The strategy combines the strength of manual design and NAS. It accomplishes this by operating on *distributions of networks* and optimizing the distributions in a way to obtain good performance for entire families of networks. The outcome of it are *RegNets*, specifically RegNetX and RegNetY, plus a range of guiding principles for the design of performant CNNs.\n"

        "The description below closely follows the reasoning in :citet:`Radosavovic.Kosaraju.Girshick.ea.2020` with some abbreviations to make it fit in the scope of the book.\n",
        "To begin, we need a template for the family of networks to explore. One of the commonalities of the designs in this chapter is that the networks consist of a *stem*, a *body* and a *head*. The stem performs initial image processing, often through convolutions with a larger window size. The body consists of multiple blocks, carrying out the bulk of the transformations needed to go from raw images to object representations. Lastly, the head converts this into the desired outputs, such as via a softmax regressor for multiclass classification.\n",
        "The body, in turn, consists of multiple stages, operating on the image at decreasing resolutions. In fact, both the stem and each subsequent stage quarter the spatial resolution. Lastly, each stage consists of one or more blocks. This pattern is common to all networks, from VGG to ResNeXt. Indeed, for the design of generic AnyNet networks, :citet:`Radosavovic.Kosaraju.Girshick.ea.2020` used the ResNeXt block of :numref:`fig_resnext_block`.\n",
        "\n",

        "![The AnyNet design space. The numbers $(\\mathit{c}, \\mathit{r})$ along each arrow indicate the number of channels $c$ and the resolution $\\mathit{r} \\times \\mathit{r}$ of the images at that point. From left to right: generic network structure composed of stem, body, and head; body composed of four stages; detailed structure of a stage; two alternative structures for blocks, one without downsampling and one that halves the resolution in each dimension. Design choices include depth $\\mathit{d_i}$, the number of output channels $\\mathit{c_i}$, the number of groups $\\mathit{g_i}$, and bottleneck ratio $\\mathit{k_i}$ for any stage $\\mathit{i}$.](http://d2l.ai/_images/anynet.svg)\n",
        ":label:`fig_anynet_full`\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's review the structure outlined in :numref:`fig_anynet_full` in detail. As mentioned, an AnyNet consists of a stem, body, and head. The stem takes as its input RGB images (3 channels), using a $3 \\times 3$ convolution with a stride of $2$, followed by a batch norm, to halve the resolution from $r \\times r$ to $r/2 \\times r/2$. Moreover, it generates $c_0$ channels that serve as input to the body.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the network is designed to work well with ImageNet images of shape $224 \\times 224 \\times 3$, the body serves to reduce this to $7 \\times 7 \\times c_4$ through 4 stages (recall that $224 / 2^{1+4} = 7$), each with an eventual stride of $2$. Lastly, the head employs an entirely standard design via global average pooling, similar to NiN (:numref:`sec_nin`), followed by a fully connected layer to emit an $n$-dimensional vector for $n$-class classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the relevant design decisions are inherent to the body of the network. It proceeds in stages, where each stage is composed of the same type of ResNeXt blocks as we discussed in :numref:`subsec_resnext`. The design there is again entirely generic: we begin with a block that halves the resolution by using a stride of $2$ (the rightmost in :numref:`fig_anynet_full`). To match this, the residual branch of the ResNeXt block needs to pass through a $1 \\times 1$ convolution. This block is followed by a variable number of additional ResNeXt blocks that leave both resolution and the number of channels unchanged. Note that a common design practice is to add a slight bottleneck in the design of convolutional blocks.\n",
        "As such, with bottleneck ratio $k_i \\geq 1$ we afford some number of channels, $c_i/k_i$,  within each block for stage $i$ (as the experiments show, this is not really effective and should be skipped). Lastly, since we are dealing with ResNeXt blocks, we also need to pick the number of groups $g_i$ for grouped convolutions at stage $i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "This seemingly generic design space provides us nonetheless with many parameters: we can set the block width (number of channels) $c_0, \\ldots c_4$, the depth (number of blocks) per stage $d_1, \\ldots d_4$, the bottleneck ratios $k_1, \\ldots k_4$, and the group widths (numbers of groups) $g_1, \\ldots g_4$.\n",
        "In total this adds up to 17 parameters, resulting in an unreasonably large number of configurations that would warrant exploring. We need some tools to reduce this huge design space effectively. This is where the conceptual beauty of design spaces comes in. Before we do so, let's implement the generic design first.\n"

        "As just discussed in :numref:`subsec_the-anynet-design-space`, parameters of a design space are hyperparameters of networks in that design space.\n",
        "Consider the problem of identifying good parameters in the AnyNet design space. We could try finding the *single best* parameter choice for a given amount of computation (e.g., FLOPs and compute time). If we allowed for even only *two* possible choices for each parameter, we would have to explore $2^{17} = 131072$ combinations to find the best solution. This is clearly infeasible because of its exorbitant cost. Even worse, we do not really learn anything from this exercise in terms of how one should design a network. Next time we add, say, an X-stage, or a shift operation, or similar, we would need to start from scratch. Even worse, due to the stochasticity in training (rounding, shuffling, bit errors), no two runs are likely to produce exactly the same results. A better strategy would be to try to determine general guidelines of how the choices of parameters should be related. For instance, the bottleneck ratio, the number of channels, blocks, groups, or their change between layers should ideally be governed by a collection of simple rules. The approach in :citet:`radosavovic2019network` relies on the following four assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We assume that general design principles actually exist, so that many networks satisfying these requirements should offer good performance. Consequently, identifying a *distribution* over networks can be a sensible strategy. In other words, we assume that there are many good needles in the haystack.\n",
        "1. We need not train networks to convergence before we can assess whether a network is good. Instead, it is sufficient to use the intermediate results as reliable guidance for final accuracy. Using (approximate) proxies to optimize an objective is referred to as multi-fidelity optimization :cite:`forrester2007multi`. Consequently, design optimization is carried out, based on the accuracy achieved after only a few passes through the dataset, reducing the cost significantly.\n",
        "1. Results obtained at a smaller scale (for smaller networks) generalize to larger ones. Consequently, optimization is carried out for networks that are structurally similar, but with a smaller number of blocks, fewer channels, etc. Only in the end will we need to verify that the so-found networks also offer good performance at scale.\n",
        "1. Aspects of the design can be approximately factorized so that it is possible to infer their effect on the quality of the outcome somewhat independently. In other words, the optimization problem is moderately easy.\n",
        "\n",
        "These assumptions allow us to test many networks cheaply. In particular, we can *sample* uniformly from the space of configurations and evaluate their performance. Subsequently, we can evaluate the quality of the choice of parameters by reviewing the *distribution* of error/accuracy that can be achieved with said networks. Denote by $F(e)$ the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for errors committed by networks of a given design space, drawn using probability disribution $p$. That is,\n",

        "Our goal is now to find a distribution $p$ over *networks* such that most networks have a very low error rate and where the support of $p$ is concise. Of course, this is computationally infeasible to perform accurately. We resort to a sample of networks $\\mathcal{Z} \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} \\{\\textrm{net}_1, \\ldots \\textrm{net}_n\\}$ (with errors $e_1, \\ldots, e_n$, respectively) from $p$ and use the empirical CDF $\\hat{F}(e, \\mathcal{Z})$ instead:\n",

        ":citet:`Radosavovic.Kosaraju.Girshick.ea.2020` experimented with a shared network bottleneck ratio $k_i = k$ for all stages $i$ of the network. This gets rid of three of the four parameters governing the bottleneck ratio. To assess whether this (negatively) affects the performance one can draw networks from the constrained and from the unconstrained distribution and compare the corresonding CDFs. It turns out that this constraint does not affect the accuracy of the distribution of networks at all, as can be seen in the first panel of :numref:`fig_regnet-fig`.\n",
        "Likewise, we could choose to pick the same group width $g_i = g$ occurring at the various stages of the network. Again, this does not affect performance, as can be seen in the second panel of :numref:`fig_regnet-fig`.\n",

By studying the best-performing networks from the distribution in $\\textrm{AnyNetX}_E$ one can observe the following: the width of the network ideally increases linearly with the block index across the network, i.e., $c_j \\approx c_0 + c_a j$, where $j$ is the block index and slope $c_a > 0$. Given that we get to choose a different block width only per stage, we arrive at a piecewise constant function, engineered to match this dependence. Furthermore, experiments also show that a bottleneck ratio of $k = 1$ performs best, i.e., we are advised not to use bottlenecks at all.\n",

        "We recommend the interested reader reviews further details in the design of specific networks for different amounts of computation by perusing :citet:`Radosavovic.Kosaraju.Girshick.ea.2020`.

The astonishing insight from the design is that it still applies, even when investigating networks at a larger scale. Even better, it even holds for Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network designs (RegNetY) that have a global channel activation :cite:`Hu.Shen.Sun.2018`.\n"

This remained the case from LeNet up until Transformers (:numref:`sec_transformer`) :cite:`Dosovitskiy.Beyer.Kolesnikov.ea.2021,touvron2021training` started surpassing CNNs in terms of accuracy. While much of the recent progress in terms of vision Transformers *can* be backported into CNNs :cite:`liu2022convnet`, it is only possible at a higher computational cost. Just as importantly, recent hardware optimizations (NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper) have only widened the gap in favor of Transformers.\n",

That learned structures prevailed is due, not least, to the availability of large image collections, such as LAION-400m and LAION-5B :cite:`schuhmann2022laion` with up to 5 billion images. Quite surprisingly, some of the more relevant work in this context even includes MLPs :cite:`tolstikhin2021mlp`.\n",

        "Designing the \"perfect\" Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) involves careful consideration of architectural choices to achieve high performance on a specific task. The paper \"On Network Design Spaces for Visual Recognition\" discusses several design principles that can be applied to create effective neural network architectures for visual recognition. Here's how you can use these design principles to design an effective MLP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Depth and Width**:\n",
        "   - **Depth**: Experiment with different numbers of layers (depth) in your MLP. Start with a moderate depth and gradually increase it while monitoring performance. Deep networks can capture complex features but may require techniques like skip connections (ResNets) to mitigate vanishing gradients.\n",
        "   - **Width**: Vary the number of neurons (width) in each layer. Wider layers can capture more complex patterns, but they may also increase the risk of overfitting. You can use techniques like dropout or batch normalization to regularize the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Skip Connections**:\n",
        "   - Consider adding skip connections between layers, similar to Residual Networks (ResNets). These connections can help alleviate vanishing gradient problems and enable the training of very deep networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Kernel Sizes**:\n",
        "   - Experiment with different kernel sizes for convolutional layers or different numbers of neurons in fully connected layers. Smaller kernels can capture fine details, while larger kernels can capture broader patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Pooling Strategies**:\n",
        "   - Use different pooling strategies like max-pooling or average pooling to downsample feature maps. The choice of pooling can affect the invariance and spatial resolution of the learned features.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Normalization**:\n",
        "   - Incorporate batch normalization layers to stabilize training and improve convergence. Batch normalization can also act as a regularizer.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Activation Functions**:\n",
        "   - Experiment with different activation functions like ReLU, Leaky ReLU, or variants like Swish. The choice of activation function can affect the network's capacity to model complex data distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Dropout**:\n",
        "   - Apply dropout with varying dropout rates to prevent overfitting. You can selectively apply dropout to certain layers or neurons based on their importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Initialization**:\n",
        "   - Use appropriate weight initialization techniques such as Xavier/Glorot initialization or He initialization. Proper initialization can expedite training and improve convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Normalization Layers**:\n",
        "   - Experiment with layer normalization or group normalization in addition to batch normalization to see if they offer advantages in your specific task.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Optimizers and Learning Rates**:\n",
        "    - Choose appropriate optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD) and learning rate schedules. Learning rate schedules like learning rate annealing or cyclic learning rates can help in training.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **Regularization Techniques**:\n",
        "    - Consider L1 and L2 regularization to control the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting. You can also explore more advanced regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, or early stopping.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **Task-Specific Architectures**:\n",
        "    - Tailor your MLP architecture to the specific task. For example, use a final softmax layer for classification tasks or a linear layer for regression tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Ensemble Learning**:\n",
        "    - Experiment with ensemble methods to combine multiple MLPs for improved performance and robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **Hyperparameter Search**:\n",
        "    - Perform systematic hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or random search to find the best combination of hyperparameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **Transfer Learning**:\n",
        "    - Consider using transfer learning by initializing your MLP with pretrained weights from a model trained on a related task. Fine-tuning the network on your specific task can significantly boost performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **Data Augmentation**:\n",
        "    - Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the effective size of your training dataset and improve the model's generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **Regularly Evaluate Performance**:\n",
        "    - Continuously monitor and evaluate the model's performance on a validation dataset. Adjust architectural choices based on performance feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that designing the \"perfect\" MLP involves an iterative process of experimentation, evaluation, and refinement. The choice of architecture and design principles should align with the specific requirements and constraints of your task and dataset."
